/**
 * BRP — Breakdown & Re-groom Planning — Phase 1 type model (B-1).
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for BRP data shapes and (in
 * later B-tasks) the pure derivation functions. It is dependency-free:
 * no React, no Zustand, no FRAME services. It can be unit-tested with
 * zero setup, and the pure functions added by B-2..B-4 must respect the
 * same purity rule (same input → same output, no side effects, no
 * `Date.now()`, no randomness).
 *
 * Three architectural invariants are enforced by the type shape itself.
 * If you find yourself wanting to add a field that violates one, do
 * not — fix the call site or compute it via a pure function instead:
 *
 *   1. Epic has NO top-level `variance`, `delta`, or `frameEstimate`
 *      field. All FRAME outputs live inside the nullable
 *      `Epic.frameResult` sub-object — present after analysis, `null`
 *      before. There is no half-populated middle state.
 *
 *   2. Pod stores `CapacityInputs` (the 5 raw inputs). It does NOT
 *      store `totalCapacity`. The total is always `computeCapacity(...)`
 *      at read time, so it can never drift from its inputs.
 *
 *   3. `VarianceBand` is a return type of `computeVariance` — never a
 *      field on any entity. Storing it is the exact bug the sample
 *      code in `docs/Brp_plan/ui_sample_brp/` made.
 *
 * Reviewer gate (per PRD AC5/AC6): grep across BRP code must show
 * zero instances of `variance:`, `delta:`, or `totalCapacity:` as a
 * field, and `brp.ts` must import nothing outside of `./brp.constants`.
